# PeakProximityParameter
MATLAB (2023a) code to reproduce (and edit) the synthetic data experiment in ICASSP 2024 paper: Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo for Pulse Fitting, by Goodyer/Ahmad/Godsill. 

The 'Plots' and 'Synthetic Pulse Data' folders are meant to be empty. When this repo is downloaded and used, the plots/metrics and synthetic data sets produced get saved to the respective folders automatically. GitHub does not seem to easily facilitate empty folders, so I have included a black document, of which you can freely cleanse yourself.

Note: amplitudes in the paper are the maximum height of the peaks, but in this code, they are the area underneath that peak.
